/**
 * The difference between regular class(normal classes) and Anonymous Inner class

 * A normal class can implement any number of interfaces but the anonymous inner class can implement only one interface at a time.
 * A regular class can extend a class and implement any number of interfaces simultaneously. But anonymous Inner class can extend a class or can implement an interface but not both at a time.
 * For regular/normal class, we can write any number of constructors but we canâ€™t write any constructor for anonymous Inner class because the anonymous class does not have any name and while defining constructor class name and constructor name must be same.
