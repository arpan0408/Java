/**
 * String :
 * A string is a sequence of characters. 
 * In java, objects of String are immutable which means a constant and cannot be changed once created. 
 * Initialize a String is one of the important pillars required as a pre-requisite with deeper understanding.
 * If a string is going to remain constant throughout the program, then use the String class object because a String object is immutable.
 * If a string can change (for example: lots of logic and operations in the construction of the string) and will only be accessed from a single thread, using a StringBuilder is good enough.
 * If a string can change and will be accessed from multiple threads, use a StringBuffer because StringBuffer is synchronous, so you have thread-safety.
 * If you donâ€™t want thread-safety than you can also go with StringBuilder class as it is not synchronized.
